With the info given in the code challenge I decided to do 2 solutions to this problem.
1. A C# solution - please see Program.cs
2. A JavaScript solution - please see index.html


I first started out by creating a JSON object to store my marble data in.
Generally speaking, the payload will be retrieved from an API or a Database call.
Once we have the data we then cast our JSON data to a List that will be used throughout the program.

I then created a list of marbles based on color. I did this to easily add the marbles from their original list into the appropriate color list.
I then created a final list that will collect the colored marbles in the ROYGBIV color order.

I then looped through each marble checking to make sure they meet the weight and palindrome requirement.
If the marble meets both of them we then place it in it appropriate color list.
Once all the marbles have been sorted into their color list I then added them to the final ROYGBIV list in the correct order.

To complete this task I created a class to house the variables and methods to do the workload of checking each marble.
You could build upon the class to additional things to the marbles if needed.
THe C# class has methods that can be expanded/reused and the main program would would be operating as an API entry point

The solution has a test case in it commented out.
You can see that I ran this code creating a loop to loop through the original marbles and randomly add on of those marbles one at a time until we hit 1 million marbles.
After running the code with the original 11 marbles and the 1 million marbles...
There is no notable time difference to complete the operation.
